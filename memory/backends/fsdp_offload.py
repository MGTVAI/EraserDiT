    Utility to shard a model with FSDP using the PyTorch Distributed fully_shard API.

    This method will over the model's named modules from the bottom-up and apply shard modules
    based on whether they meet any of the criteria from shard_conditions.

    Args:
        model (TransformerDecoder): Model to shard with FSDP.
        cpu_offload (bool): If set to True, FSDP will offload parameters, gradients, and optimizer
            states to CPU.
        reshard_after_forward (bool): Whether to reshard parameters and buffers after
            the forward pass. Setting this to True corresponds to the FULL_SHARD sharding strategy
            from FSDP1, while setting it to False corresponds to the SHARD_GRAD_OP sharding strategy.
        mesh (Optional[DeviceMesh]): Device mesh to use for FSDP sharding under multiple parallelism.
            Default to None.
        fsdp_shard_conditions (List[Callable[[str, nn.Module], bool]]): A list of functions to determine
            which modules to shard with FSDP.
        pin_cpu_memory (bool): If set to True, FSDP will pin the CPU memory of the offloaded parameters.
